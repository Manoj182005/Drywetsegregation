# Dry and Wet Waste Segregation System

This project is designed to automatically segregate dry and wet waste using **sensors and microcontrollers**.  
It was built as part of a hackathon/college project.

## 🚀 Features
- Automatic waste detection (dry/wet)
- Smart mapping for dustbins
- ESP32 + Arduino code integration
- Data collection for monitoring

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- ESP32, Arduino IDE
- Python for backend data handling
- HTML for visualization

## 📂 Project Structure
- `code/` → main source code
- `esp32wetdry arduino code/` → Arduino scripts
- `maping for dustbin/` → mapping logic
- `Smart_Waste_Management_Hackathon_Template/` → project documentation

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Upload Arduino code to ESP32
3. Run Python script for monitoring
4. Connect hardware setup
